# What is Lack&deg;

Lack&deg; is a very simple, file based, CMS. It runs on the CodeIgniter framework.

For now only markdown formatting is supported, but you can also use pure html in your data files.



## Using as a Spark

There are 3 things you need to do to make the spark work:

1. Change the routes config for both the default controller and the 404 override to point to the same controller, ie. welcome.
2. Run the spark in your index method of the default controller: $this->lack->run()
3. Create the same data folder structure as found in the example app https://github.com/bstrahija/Lack



## Single entry usage

All the data files are inside the **/data** directory. The name of the file (without the extension) coresponds to the URI segment.

Example URI for the file **/data/about.md**

	http://yoursite.com/about



## Entry list usage

If you want a list of entries (something like a blog), just create a subfolder in the **/data** directory.

A blog would then look something like this:

	/data
		blog
			first_entry
			second_entry
			third_entry

And the URL's:

	http://yoursite.com/blog/first_entry
	http://yoursite.com/blog/second_entry
	http://yoursite.com/blog/third_entry

A list of those entries is created automaticaly in the following URL:
	
	http://yoursite.com/blog

You can add meta data to your entries by simply adding some JSON data in your data files. The simples example is adding a title that is displayed in the list:

	{ "title": "One" }

	##One

	Lorem ipsum dolor...



## Assets

All the site assets (CSS, JavaScript, Images, etc.) are located in the directory **/data/assets**.



## Templates

The templates are located in the directory **/data/assets/templates**.

The default template used to display the data files is **layout.php**. And the template used to display a list of entries is **layout_list.php**.

There's also a possibility to use partials. The template directory has 2 subfolders **core** and **partials**. 
You can place your partials in any of them, but best practice is to put the **header**, **footer**, **aside** and **navigation** partials in the **core** folder.

Then you can simply include the partials in the templates. An example would be something like this:

	{header}
	
	{navigation}
	
	<article>{content}</article>
	
	{aside}
	
	{footer}

Simple, right?

The template for the entry list would then look like this:

	{header}
	
	{navigation}
	
	<ul>
		{entries}
			<li>
				<h2><a href="{permalink}">{title}</a></h2>
				<h3>{when}</h3>
				<p>{summary}</p>
			</li>
		{/entries}
	</ul>
	
	{aside}
	
	{footer}
